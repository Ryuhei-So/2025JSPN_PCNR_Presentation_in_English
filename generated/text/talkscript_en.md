# Talk Script: Miscellaneous Tasks and Hacks

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**[Duration: 30 seconds]**

"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining this session. My name is Ryuhei Song, and I'm a psychiatrist at Okayama Psychiatric Medical Center and also work in digital therapeutics development at CureApp.

Today, I want to share some unconventional perspectives on work management in healthcare - specifically about what we call 'miscellaneous tasks' and how we can 'hack' our way to more meaningful work. This isn't your typical efficiency talk - it's about working smarter by sometimes refusing to be efficient."

---

## Slide 2: COI Disclosure
**[Duration: 20 seconds]**

"Before we begin, let me quickly cover my conflict of interest disclosures. I receive salary and stock options from CureApp, hold several patents related to digital therapeutics, and receive research funding and lecture fees from various pharmaceutical companies. These are listed here for transparency."

---

## Slide 3: Abstract Overview
**[Duration: 45 seconds]**

"Let me outline what we'll cover today. First, I'll be honest with you - I'm not particularly busy, and I'm not especially efficient either. But here's the interesting part: I don't suffer from what most people call 'miscellaneous tasks.'

We'll explore a four-category classification system for work, examine how being too busy can actually make us misclassify important work as trivial, and discuss what I mean by 'hacking' - which is essentially about not playing games that don't serve us and sometimes breaking rules to achieve better outcomes.

The key principle I want you to remember is this: Don't make miscellaneous tasks more efficient - eliminate them. Instead, focus your efficiency efforts on work that truly matters."

---

## Slide 4: Current Work Distribution
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"Let me give you some context about my current work situation versus where I was seven years ago. Today, I work only one day per week in clinical practice - specifically in our addiction outpatient clinic. The rest of my time is split between digital therapeutics development at CureApp, research in my spare time, and graduate studies in ethics at Kyoto University.

Compare this to 2018, when I was working full-time clinical hours with overtime, taking on-call duties, and managing ward responsibilities. This transformation didn't happen by accident - it was the result of deliberately applying the principles I'm going to share with you today.

The key insight here is that I didn't just become more efficient at doing the same things - I fundamentally changed what I was doing."

---

## Slide 5: Current Status
**[Duration: 75 seconds]**

"Now, I want to be completely transparent about three things. First, I'm not particularly busy anymore. My clinical work is limited to one day per week with no administrative responsibilities, I work collaboratively with team members, and I've learned the crucial skill of declining requests that don't align with my goals.

Second, I'm not very efficient. This presentation took me about eight hours to prepare. My writing speed is only about 1,000 Japanese characters or 250 English words per hour. I procrastinate, and I often need external rewards to start tasks.

But here's the third point, and it's the most important: Despite not being busy or particularly efficient, I don't suffer from miscellaneous tasks. Why? Because I've learned to classify work differently, and I've structured my professional life to avoid the traps that create these meaningless tasks in the first place.

This is what I mean by 'hacking' - it's not about doing the wrong things faster, it's about not doing the wrong things at all."

---

## Slide 6: Professional Communication Strategy
**[Duration: 45 seconds]**

"Let me briefly address the elephant in the room - you might wonder how someone who works part-time and admits to being inefficient gets invited to speak at conferences. The answer is strategic self-promotion and institutional positioning.

I actively use social media for professional visibility, my media appearances are facilitated by my institutional affiliations, and I genuinely enjoy academic writing - though I'll admit the publication game can be somewhat addictive.

Regarding AI integration, I'm not heavily dependent on AI for efficiency, but I do focus on outcome-driven preparation. I think strategically about what I want to achieve before I start working, rather than just working harder."

---

## Slide 7: What Are Miscellaneous Tasks?
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"So what exactly are miscellaneous tasks? At their core, they're various small, fragmented work activities that share four dangerous characteristics.

First, they're trivial - meaning they have low actual value for your core mission. Second, they're unnamed - they don't get formal recognition or evaluation in your performance reviews. Third, because they're not evaluated, they're unmanaged - no one takes responsibility for controlling or eliminating them. And fourth, they proliferate - they multiply like weeds because there's no systematic control.

Here's the crucial insight: work that has low value and receives no evaluation will not be managed, and therefore will continue to grow. This is why simply becoming more efficient at these tasks is counterproductive - you're just ensuring they'll stick around and multiply."

---

## Slide 8: Four-Category Work Classification
**[Duration: 90 seconds]**

"This brings us to my four-category framework for classifying all work. We have two dimensions: the actual value of the work, and how much it's evaluated or recognized by the organization.

In the bottom left, we have 'True Miscellaneous Tasks' - work that has low value and receives low evaluation. This is work that genuinely should be eliminated, though in reality, there isn't much of this category.

Top left gives us 'Bullshit Jobs' - work that has low value but receives high evaluation and resources. We'll discuss this category in detail shortly.

Bottom right contains 'False Miscellaneous Tasks' - work that has high value but receives low evaluation. This is where many healthcare professionals find themselves trapped, doing important work that isn't recognized.

Finally, top right represents 'Work That Should Be Streamlined' - high value work that receives appropriate evaluation and resources. This is where you want to focus your efficiency efforts.

Here's the key insight: if you make true miscellaneous tasks more efficient, they become preserved in your workflow. The organization says, 'Oh, you can handle these quickly, so we'll keep giving them to you.'"

---

## Slide 9: Professional Evaluation
**[Duration: 30 seconds]**

"When I say 'high evaluation,' I mean something very specific: sufficient resources are allocated to that work. In our professional world, evaluation ultimately translates to financial and time resources. If work is truly valued, organizations invest in it properly. If it's not getting resources, it's not truly valued, regardless of what people say."

---

## Slide 10: How Busyness Increases Miscellaneous Tasks
**[Duration: 75 seconds]**

"Here's a critical insight about how excessive busyness creates a vicious cycle. When you're overwhelmed, everything starts to feel like a miscellaneous task. Work that actually belongs in the 'high value' categories gets subjectively experienced as low-value busywork.

This is dangerous because it leads to what I call 'misclassification.' You might start treating important patient care activities, research, or professional development as if they were trivial tasks to be rushed through. The psychological experience of being overwhelmed makes it difficult to distinguish between work that truly matters and work that doesn't.

This is why I argue that being less busy can actually make you more effective. When you have adequate time and mental space, you can properly evaluate the true importance of different tasks and allocate your energy accordingly.

The goal isn't to handle more tasks more efficiently - it's to handle the right tasks with appropriate attention."

---

## Slide 11: Dealing with Miscellaneous Tasks - Ideal vs Reality
**[Duration: 90 seconds]**

"Now let's talk about how to actually deal with each category of work, comparing the ideal approach with organizational reality.

For True Miscellaneous Tasks, ideally you'd just eliminate them. In reality, there aren't many tasks that are both low-value and low-evaluation - most organizations eventually stop doing things that nobody cares about.

For False Miscellaneous Tasks - high-value work that's undervalued - the ideal approach is to increase their recognition and evaluation. We'll discuss strategies for this shortly.

Bullshit Jobs present the biggest challenge. Ideally, you'd eliminate them entirely. In reality, trying to eliminate work that the organization highly evaluates, even when it's pointless, often results in being criticized or even terminated. This is where we need to think about 'hacking' strategies.

Finally, for Work That Should Be Streamlined, both ideally and in reality, you want to optimize these processes since they're both valuable and properly resourced.

The key insight is that individual employees often lack the authority to change the evaluation or existence of different types of work. This is where strategic thinking becomes crucial."

---

## Slide 12: Bullshit Jobs - Definition
**[Duration: 75 seconds]**

"The concept of 'Bullshit Jobs' comes from anthropologist David Graeber's influential work. He defined them as forms of employment that are so completely pointless, unnecessary, or even harmful that even the employee cannot justify their existence, yet they feel obliged to pretend otherwise.

Graeber identified five specific categories. Flunkies are workers who must pretend their role isn't as pointless as they know it to be - they exist mainly to make someone else look important. Goons exist primarily due to competitive dynamics - if other organizations have them, we feel we need them too. Duct Tapers spend their time fixing problems that shouldn't exist in the first place. Box Tickers create the illusion that something useful is being done when it isn't. And Taskmasters supervise people who don't actually need supervision.

In healthcare, we see these everywhere: unnecessary administrative approvals, redundant documentation, competitive credentialing processes that don't improve patient care, and supervisory roles that exist mainly to satisfy organizational charts rather than actual need.

The key point is that these jobs often receive high organizational evaluation and resources, even though they create little or no value."

---

## Slide 13: Gentle Approach to False Miscellaneous Tasks
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"False Miscellaneous Tasks represent a significant opportunity. These are activities that create real value but don't receive appropriate recognition or resources. In healthcare, this might include time spent educating patients, developing new treatment protocols, or mentoring junior colleagues.

The strategy here is gradual elevation - slowly increasing the evaluation and recognition of this valuable work. This might involve documenting outcomes, presenting results at meetings, connecting your work to organizational priorities, or finding allies who can help advocate for proper recognition.

For example, if you're spending time on quality improvement activities that aren't formally recognized, you might start tracking metrics, reporting results, and gradually building a case for why this work deserves official support and resources.

The key is patience and strategic thinking. You're not trying to work harder at these tasks - you're trying to move them from the 'low evaluation' to 'high evaluation' column."

---

## Slide 14: Task Hacking Philosophy
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"This brings us to what I call 'task hacking.' In the technology world, hackers are known for two key behaviors: they don't play games they can't win, and they break rules when those rules don't serve their purposes.

Applied to work management, this means refusing to participate in systems that waste your time and energy, and sometimes deliberately not following procedures that create more problems than they solve.

For True Miscellaneous Tasks, a hacker simply doesn't do them. For Bullshit Jobs, a hacker finds ways to minimize participation without getting fired. For False Miscellaneous Tasks, a hacker works to change the game rules so that valuable work gets properly recognized.

This isn't about being rebellious for its own sake - it's about being strategically non-compliant with systems that prevent you from doing your best work. The goal is to hack your way toward spending more time on work that actually matters."

---

## Slide 15: Task Hacking - Reality vs Ideal
**[Duration: 75 seconds]**

"Now, let's be realistic about the challenges of task hacking. The fundamental problem is that individual team members usually don't have the authority to eliminate tasks or change how work is evaluated.

This leaves you with three basic hacking strategies, each with different risk profiles. First, you can choose not to play the game at all by leaving the organization. This is the most radical option, but sometimes it's the only way to escape systems that consistently waste your talents.

Second, you can selectively break rules by simply not doing certain tasks. This requires careful judgment about which rules you can safely ignore and which ones will get you in serious trouble.

Third, you can work to gain enough authority within the system to change the rules for everyone. This is often the most sustainable long-term approach, but it requires patience and political skill.

The reality is that meaningful change often requires senior leadership support. Individual hacking can help you personally, but systemic change needs organizational commitment."

---

## Slide 16: Efficient Handling of Streamlined Work
**[Duration: 90 seconds]**

"When you do have work that's both valuable and properly supported, this is where you want to focus your efficiency efforts. The key strategy is reverse engineering from desired outcomes.

Instead of asking 'How can I do this task?' ask 'What outcome do I want, and what's the minimum viable path to achieve it?' For patient care, this might mean asking 'How can this patient achieve the best possible outcome in the shortest reasonable time?' For research, it's 'What's the clearest path from hypothesis to publication to real-world implementation?'

This outcome-focused thinking naturally leads you to leverage other people and tools effectively. Use generative AI for appropriate tasks, work with medical clerks and administrative staff, and invest in systems that automate routine processes.

For example, we implemented an automated on-call scheduling system that eliminated hours of manual coordination. We didn't make the manual process more efficient - we eliminated the need for manual work entirely.

The principle is this: for work that truly matters, invest in the best possible tools and processes. For work that doesn't matter, invest in elimination strategies."

---

## Slide 17: On-Call Scheduling System - GauDi
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"Let me give you a concrete example of what I mean by strategic automation. We implemented a system called GauDi for on-call scheduling, which demonstrates the difference between making bad work more efficient versus eliminating the need for bad work.

Previously, creating on-call schedules involved multiple rounds of emails, phone calls, manual coordination, and frequent last-minute changes that required more communication. The system handles preference surveys automatically, sends individual notifications, provides easy mobile and desktop access, exports to various formats, prevents scheduling conflicts, and automatically communicates changes to relevant staff.

The key insight is that we didn't make the manual scheduling process more efficient - we eliminated the need for manual scheduling entirely. This freed up hours of administrative time that could be redirected to patient care and other valuable activities.

This is what good automation looks like: it eliminates categories of work rather than just speeding them up."

---

## Slide 18: Task Shooting Method
**[Duration: 45 seconds]**

"Beyond traditional to-do lists, I want to briefly mention time-based task management approaches. Rather than just listing what needs to be done, these methods focus on when tasks will be executed and how long they'll take.

This systematic approach to task completion integrates with calendar systems and helps you make realistic commitments about what you can actually accomplish. The goal is to move from reactive task handling to proactive time management.

The key principle is that tasks without specific time allocations tend to expand and create the subjective experience of being overwhelmed by miscellaneous work."

---

## Slide 19: Take Home Messages
**[Duration: 90 seconds]**

"Let me leave you with four key principles that I hope will change how you think about work management.

First, don't make miscellaneous tasks more efficient. When you get really good at handling low-value work, organizations will give you more low-value work. Instead, focus on elimination and reclassification strategies.

Second, recognize that excessive busyness increases your subjective experience of miscellaneous tasks. When you're overwhelmed, everything feels trivial. Creating space and boundaries actually improves your ability to identify what's truly important.

Third, remember that senior leadership has the real power to eliminate or reduce miscellaneous tasks. If you're in a leadership position, use that authority responsibly. If you're not, part of your strategy should be building relationships with people who can make systemic changes.

Fourth, when you do have work that's both valuable and properly supported, apply rigorous outcome-focused thinking. Reverse engineer from your desired results and invest in the best possible tools and processes.

The overall goal isn't to work harder or even to work more efficiently in a general sense. It's to work more intelligently by refusing to participate in systems that waste human potential."

**[Duration: Variable]**

"Thank you for your attention. I know these ideas challenge some conventional wisdom about productivity and efficiency, and I'm very interested in your questions and reactions.

I'm particularly curious to hear about your own experiences with different categories of work tasks, and whether this framework helps you think differently about how you allocate your time and energy.

Please feel free to approach me after the session as well if you'd like to continue the conversation. Thank you."
